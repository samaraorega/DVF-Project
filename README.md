In the colab notebook above, the project begins by giving a summary of what the business problem is all about. It then shows the understanding of the data and gives a cheat sheet of what the columns in the data sets represents.
A preview of the data is then given. The data sets are cleaned then visualized. There are graphs plotted to support our findings then a conclusion and recommendation is given based on the findings made from the plots.
